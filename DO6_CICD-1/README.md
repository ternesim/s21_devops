### Part 1. Setting up the **gitlab-runner**

##### Start *Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS* virtual machine
*Be prepared to save a dump of the virtual machine image at the end of the project*

##### Download and install **gitlab-runner** on the virtual machine

##### Run **gitlab-runner** and register it for use in the current project (*DO6_CICD*)
- You will need a URL and a token for runner registration, that can be obtained from the task page on the platform.

### Part 2. Building

#### Write a stage for **CI** to build applications from the *C2_SimpleBashUtils* project:

##### In the _gitlab-ci.yml_ file, add a stage to start the building via makefile from the _C2_ project

##### Save post-build files (artifacts) to a random directory with a 30-day retention period.


### Part 3. Codestyle test

#### Write a stage for **CI** that runs a codestyle script (*clang-format*):

##### If the codefile didn't pass, " fail" the pipeline

##### In the pipeline, display the output of the *clang-format* utility

### Part 4. Integration tests

#### Write a stage for **CI** that runs your integration tests from the same project:

##### Run this stage automatically only if the build and codestyle test passes successfully

##### If tests didn't pass, fail the pipeline

##### In the pipeline, display the output of the succeeded / failed integration tests

### Part 5. Deployment stage

##### Start the second virtual machine *Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS*

#### Write a stage for **CD** that "deploys" the project on another virtual machine:

##### Run this stage manually, if all the previous stages have passed successfully

##### Write a bash script which copies the files received after the building (artifacts) into the */usr/local/bin* directory of the second virtual machine using **ssh** and **scp**

##### In the _gitlab-ci.yml_ file, add a stage to run the script you have written

##### In case of an error, fail the pipeline

As a result, you should have applications from the *C2_SimpleBashUtils* (s21_cat and s21_grep) project ready to run on the second virtual machine.

##### Save dumps of virtual machine images
**p.s. Do not upload dumps to git under any circumstances!**
- Don't forget to run the pipeline with the last commit in the repository.

### Part 6. Bonus. Notifications

##### Set up notifications of successful/unsuccessful pipeline execution via bot named "[your nickname] DO6 CI/CD" in *Telegram*
- The text of the notification must contain information on the successful passing of both **CI** and **CD** stages.
- The rest of the notification text may be arbitrary.
